### Nice features:
* possibility to write complex equation with parentheses
* showing full equation
* possibility to use keyboard

### Known issues:
* in current version of the component could occur problems with decimal and big numbers. In JavaScript all numbers are IEEE 754 floating point numbers. Due to the binary nature of their encoding, some decimal numbers cannot be represented with perfect accuracy.  

### Quick setup:

In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm test```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

```npm run build```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
